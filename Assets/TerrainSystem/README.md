# Voxel Terrain System

This module implements a deformable voxel terrain system that allows for real-time terrain modification, tunnel creation, and supports player-built structures.

## Core Components

- **VoxelData**: Represents the data for a single voxel in the terrain
- **TerrainChunk**: Manages a section of the terrain's voxel data and mesh
- **MarchingCubesMeshGenerator**: Generates smooth meshes from voxel data using the marching cubes algorithm
- **TerrainManager**: Controls and coordinates the terrain system, handling chunk loading and modification

## Multiplayer Considerations

The system is designed with future multiplayer functionality in mind:
- Clear separation between data and visual representation
- Authority-based modification system
- Serializable terrain operations for network transmission

## Performance Optimizations

- Chunk-based approach for efficient updating and rendering
- Custom job system for mesh generation
- Optimized data structures for minimal memory usage
- GPU-accelerated mesh generation where possible
